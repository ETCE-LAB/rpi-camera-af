## Overview

We have constructed an advanced module using the **Raspberry Pi 4** as the core processing unit. Attached to it is an **FS90 servo motor**, which offers precise movement and positioning capabilities essential for our project's requirements.

Additionally, we have integrated an image sensor capable of capturing high-quality visuals, which is further enhanced by a **wide-angle lens** to broaden the field of view and capture more of the surroundings in a single frame.

To house and mount these components effectively, we designed and **3D-printed a custom mounting object**. This mount not only secures the components firmly but also aligns them perfectly to ensure optimal performance of the imaging system.

This setup is particularly useful for applications requiring detailed visual data over a wide area, such as in robotics, surveillance, and automated monitoring systems.
